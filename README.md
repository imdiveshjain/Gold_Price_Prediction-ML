# Gold_Price_Prediction-ML

This project aims to predict the future prices of gold using machine learning techniques. The prediction model is built and trained using historical data on gold prices, and various machine learning algorithms are explored to find the best-performing model.

Data
The dataset used in this project contains historical gold prices, including features such as date, opening price, closing price, highest price, lowest price, and volume. The dataset is preprocessed in the Jupyter Notebook to handle missing values, normalize the data, and extract relevant features for the machine learning model.

Dependencies
Make sure to have the following libraries installed:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
